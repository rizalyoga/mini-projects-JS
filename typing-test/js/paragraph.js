  "Salah satu kunci utama dalam belajar pemrograman adalah praktik. Mengapa demikian? Melalui praktik, kamu bisa langsung menerapkan konsep-konsep yang telah dipelajari. Proses ini bukan hanya tentang membaca teori atau menonton tutorial, tetapi benar-benar menulis kode dan melihat hasilnya. Saat kamu mulai membuat program JavaScript, kamu akan mengalami proses trial and error. Setiap kesalahan yang kamu temui dan masalah yang diselesaikan akan meningkatkan pemahamanmu tentang bagaimana JavaScript bekerja. Selain itu, JavaScript adalah bahasa yang sangat populer dan banyak dipakai dalam web development. Dengan mempraktikkan pembuatan program JavaScript, kamu juga mempelajari cara memecahkan masalah dan mengembangkan logika pemrograman.",
  "Di artikel ini, kita akan menjelajahi berbagai contoh program JavaScript, mulai dari membuat pesan sederhana muncul di console sampai merancang aplikasi to-do list, setiap contoh akan membawa pemahaman mendalam tentang JavaScript. Yuk, simak! Memasuki pemrograman JavaScript bisa menjadi petualangan menarik sekaligus membingungkan bagi pemula. Bayangkan, dengan beberapa baris kode, kamu bisa mengubah halaman web statis menjadi sesuatu yang interaktif. Di artikel ini, kita akan menjelajahi berbagai contoh program JavaScript, mulai dari membuat pesan sederhana muncul di console sampai merancang aplikasi to-do list, setiap contoh akan membawa pemahaman mendalam tentang JavaScript. Yuk, simak!",
  "So I started to walk into the water. I won't lie to you boys, I was terrified. But I pressed on, and as I made my way past the breakers a strange calm came over me. I don't know if it was divine intervention or the kinship of all living things but I tell you Jerry at that moment, I was a marine biologist. You can also use variant modifiers to target media queries like responsive breakpoints, dark mode, prefers-reduced-motion, and more. With CSS files this small, you dont have to worry about complex solutions like code-splitting your CSS for each page, and can instead just ship a single small CSS file thats downloaded once and cached until you redeploy your site.",
  "JavaScript JS is a lightweight interpreted or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache Couchdb and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative functional programming styles. This section is dedicated to the JavaScript language itself, and not the parts that are specific to Web pages or other host environments. For information about APIs that are specific to Web pages, please see Web APIs and DOM.",
  "The object-oriented nature of JavaScript is important to understand if you want to go further with your knowledge of the language and write more efficient code, therefore we've provided this module to help you. Continues our coverage of JavaScript's key fundamental features, turning our attention to commonly-encountered types of code blocks such as conditional statements, loops, functions, and events. Discusses asynchronous JavaScript, why it is important, and how it can be used to effectively handle potential blocking operations such as fetching resources from a server. Explores what APIs are, and how to use some of the most common APIs you'll come across often in your development work.",
  "JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations, clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects.",
  "JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript. In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.",
  "JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed. Object-oriented. No distinction between types of objects. Inheritance is through the prototype mechanism, and properties and methods can be added to any object dynamically. Class-based. Objects are divided into classes and instances with all inheritance through the class hierarchy. Classes and instances cannot have properties or methods added dynamically. Variable data types must be declared (static typing, strongly typed).",
